          <h2>Roots & Academics</h2>
          <p>
            My story began on <strong>April 3, 2007</strong>, at USM Hospital in Kabacan, Cotabato. While that is where I took my first breath, my childhood memories are rooted in the soils of Kilada, Matalam. I am Jed Andrez Gesulga, though to those who know me best, I am simply <strong>Biboy</strong>. Growing up, I navigated the world with a quiet curiosity, eventually finding my path to higher education where I now stand at the threshold of my future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am a first-year student at <strong>MSU-IIT</strong>, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Applications. Fate has a funny way of steering us; I was moments away from attending Southeastern Mindanao University for Statistics, but a last-minute change of heart redirected my compass here. It was the best decision I could have made. I have found my tribe here—amazing people like <strong>Gian</strong> and the spirited Section B181—who transform the rigors of college life into a journey full of laughter and shared learning.

          <h2>The Inner World</h2>
          <p>
            I navigate the world as an <strong>INFJ</strong>, a rare personality type defined by deep empathy, intuition, and a constant search for meaning. For as long as I can remember, I have been drawn to the unseen currents of emotion that flow between people. I don't just observe the world; I feel it. This introspection allows me to understand perspectives that others might miss, fueling a desire to create genuine connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I refuse to let my thoughts remain just thoughts. I believe that reflection is useless without action. While I am naturally thoughtful and sometimes reserved, I take deliberate steps to turn my internal realizations into external improvements. Whether it is helping a friend or refining my own character, I strive to balance cold logic with warm compassion, ensuring that my impact on the world is both smart and kind.

          <h2>Family & Home</h2>
          <p>
           If you want to know who I truly am, look at my <strong>family</strong>. We are a tight-knit unit of five: Mama, my late Papa, Ate Yen, Ate Andree, Kuya JB, and myself. Our home is made even livelier by the <strong>chaotic joy</strong> of our four dogs: Choco, King, Aki, and Webby. I take immense pride in my role within this circle; protecting them, caring for them, and ensuring their <strong>happiness</strong> is not just a duty, but the very <strong>heart</strong> of my purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the most defining chapters of my life was traveling to Taiwan with them. It was more than just a vacation; it was a <strong>transformative experience</strong> that expanded my world. Witnessing the beauty of a foreign land alongside the people I love most taught me that life is about <strong>shared moments</strong> and connection. That trip remains a vivid reminder that the world is full of wonders waiting to be explored together, and that the deepest joy comes from experiencing it with those who hold your heart.

          <h2>Music</h2>
          <p>
          Music has always been more than just sound to me—it is a companion, a source of comfort, and a reflection of my soul. I have loved <strong>IV of Spades</strong> for as long as I can remember, and I have been waiting with bated breath for their comeback since before the pandemic. Their songs carry a mix of nostalgia, joy, and raw emotion that resonates deeply with me, reminding me that some music feels timeless and personal.
          </p>
          <p>
           Beyond them, my love for <strong>K-pop</strong> has grown, especially for <strong>Aespa</strong> and <strong>Le Sserafim</strong>. Their artistry, energy, and passion inspire me, and their music adds a vibrant, dynamic rhythm to my life. While my taste spans many genres, I find myself drawn most to <strong>indie pop</strong>, the kind of music that feels intimate, reflective, and soothing—songs that echo the quiet moments of thought, hope, and longing in everyday life. Music, in all its forms, continues to shape who I am and how I see the world.

          <h2>Behind the Lens</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Photography</strong> is my greatest passion because it allows me to freeze time. Behind the lens, I become a storyteller, capturing fleeting moments that might otherwise fade into oblivion. This drive to celebrate the visual arts inspired me to organize competitions during the <em>DSPC</em>, where I could provide a platform for others to showcase their creativity and connect through art.
          </p>
          <p>
           That desire to serve has followed me into college, where I now work with the <strong>Student Council Documentation Committee</strong>. Here, I am surrounded by approachable seniors who inspire me daily. It is a new arena, but the goal remains the same: to contribute to the community, to learn from those around me, and to leave a positive impact through service and teamwork.

          <h2>Discipline & Faith</h2>
          <p>
           I believe motivation may spark the first step, but <strong>discipline</strong> carries you through the journey. I strive to live intentionally, nurturing my body with wholesome food and challenging it through consistent exercise. Each drop of sweat, each moment of discomfort in the gym, teaches me <strong>perseverance</strong> and reminds me that growth often comes through struggle. This dedication strengthens not only my body but also sharpens my mind, allowing me to face challenges and learn with clarity and focus.
          <p>
            Yet true strength is incomplete without a foundation in <strong>faith</strong>. Church is my sanctuary and my guide; it humbles me, fills me with gratitude, and anchors me in a purpose greater than myself. The quiet moments of prayer, reflection, and worship remind me to stay grounded, even as I chase my personal goals. Balancing the rigor of the physical with the serenity of the spiritual creates harmony in my life, teaching me that striving for excellence is meaningful only when it walks hand in hand with <strong>gratitude</strong> and a heart rooted in God.

          <h2>Leadership Journey</h2>
          <p>
          My journey into <strong>leadership</strong> began in the structured and demanding world of high school, where I took on the role of Alpha First Platoon Leader during Citizenship Advancement Training. The responsibility was immense, and the challenges often pushed me to my limits, but it was within that pressure that I discovered the <strong>strength</strong>, <strong>resilience</strong>, and <strong>courage</strong> I never knew I had. Every drill, every decision, and every long day became a lesson—not just in leadership, but in patience, trust, and the power of guiding others with care.
          </p>
          <p>
           Amid the challenges, I found something even more precious: <strong>connection</strong>. I met friends who became family—Karmia, Harvey, and the rest of “the 17 of us.” Together, we laughed, struggled, and grew, forming bonds that distance and time cannot weaken. Even now, reflecting on those days fills me with warmth and gratitude, reminding me that true leadership is measured not only by responsibility, but by the lives you touch and the hearts you leave changed.
